**Date:** 2025-12-14

## Problem Statement

The current name "BAZINGA" (inspired by Big Bang Theory) was chosen early in development when the project had different scope. Now the project has matured into a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration framework with:

- **7 specialized AI agents** coordinated as a development team
- **Agentic Context Engineering (ACE)** architecture
- **Parallel development** with 1-4 concurrent developers
- **3-tier problem-solving** (standard review, structured frameworks, deep investigation)
- **Automatic quality gates** (security, lint, coverage)
- **Technology-specific specialization** via dynamic context loading

The name should convey:
1. **Multi-agent coordination** - This isn't a single AI helper
2. **Team metaphor** - Agents work together like a real dev team
3. **Orchestration** - Intelligent coordination and workflow management
4. **Speed/parallelism** - Multiple developers working simultaneously
5. **Quality focus** - Built-in gates and review processes
6. **Professional credibility** - Suitable for enterprise adoption

Best names for typing in terminal daily:

1. **Crew** - `crew init` (4 chars)
2. **Guild** - `guild init` (5 chars)
3. **Forge** - `forge init` (5 chars)

### For Marketing/Enterprise

Best for professional adoption:

1. **Ensemble** - Sophisticated, collaborative

- Excellent CLI experience (`crew orchestrate`)
- Professional yet approachable
- Natural extensions (Crew Pro, Crew Dashboard)
- Works for both startups and enterprises

**Risk mitigation:**
- Generic name means strong brand identity needed
- Consider "DevCrew" or "CodeCrew" if domain unavailable

### Backup: **Forge**

**Why:**
- Strong creation/building metaphor
- Professional feel
- Good CLI (`forge build`, `forge orchestrate`)
- Evokes quality craftsmanship

### Honorable Mention: **Ensemble**

**Why:**
- Most sophisticated
- Captures multi-agent harmony
- Unique in dev tools space
- May resonate with enterprise buyers

## Critical Analysis

### Pros of Renaming

1. **Better communication** - Current users often don't know what BAZINGA means
2. **SEO improvement** - Generic terms like "crew" + specific modifiers can rank
3. **Professional credibility** - TV show reference may seem unprofessional
4. **Global appeal** - "BAZINGA" may not translate well internationally

### Cons of Renaming

1. **Existing recognition** - Some users know BAZINGA already
2. **Migration effort** - Updating all docs, CLI, packages
3. **Potential confusion** - Existing users may be disoriented
4. **Trademark risk** - Popular short names may have trademark issues

### Verdict

**Rename recommended.** The project has evolved beyond the playful BAZINGA name. A more professional name better communicates the sophisticated multi-agent orchestration capabilities.

---

## Implementation Considerations

If renaming proceeds:

### Phase 1: Decision
- [ ] User selects final name
- [ ] Domain availability check
- [ ] Trademark search

### Phase 2: Technical Migration
- [ ] Rename CLI command (bazinga → new_name)
- [ ] Update pyproject.toml package name
- [ ] Update all documentation references
- [ ] Update agent files and prompts
- [ ] Update GitHub repository name
- [ ] Create redirects from old name

### Phase 3: Communication
- [ ] Announce rename with rationale
- [ ] Update README with migration guide
- [ ] Deprecation period for old name (6 months?)

---

## Questions for User

Before finalizing, please consider:

1. **Priority:** Is CLI typing speed more important than marketing appeal?
2. **Audience:** Primary users are developers, enterprises, or both?
3. **Tone:** Playful/approachable vs. professional/serious?
4. **Domain:** Must have .com/.dev, or alternatives acceptable?
5. **Any names to avoid:** Personal preferences or constraints?

## Multi-LLM Review Integration

### Critical Issues Identified by GPT-5

The OpenAI review exposed **major flaws** in the original analysis:

#### 1. Name Collision Crisis (CRITICAL)

My top picks have **direct conflicts** with existing products:

| Original Pick | Conflict | Risk Level |
|---------------|----------|------------|
| **Crew** | CrewAI - major multi-agent framework | 🔴 FATAL |
| **Forge** | Atlassian Forge platform | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Cadence** | Netflix Conductor, Cadence Design Systems | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Guild** | Guild AI | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| **Nexus** | Sonatype Nexus | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Velocity** | Common in agile tooling | 🟡 MEDIUM |

**Verdict:** Original Top 10 is mostly unusable. CrewAI is particularly problematic as it's a direct competitor in the multi-agent space.

#### 2. Migration Complexity Underestimated

The codebase has `bazinga/` hardcoded in:
- All agent definitions (bazinga/*.json paths)
- Skills (bazinga-db skill)
- Templates (bazinga/templates/)
- State files (bazinga/bazinga.db)
- CLI installer scripts

**Recommendation from review:** Keep internal `bazinga/` paths for 1-2 major versions, only change external brand/CLI name.

#### 3. SEO/Discoverability Problem

Single-word generic nouns are:
- Nearly impossible to rank in search
- Easily confused with existing products
- Hard to trademark

### Brand Architecture Recommendation

Following GPT-5's suggestion for a staged approach:

```
PUBLIC BRAND: [New Name] (e.g., Orchestrix)
├── CLI: orchestrix
├── Website: orchestrix.dev
├── PyPI: orchestrix-cli
└── Docs: "Orchestrix Documentation"

INTERNAL CODENAME: bazinga (retained)
├── State folder: bazinga/ (unchanged)
├── Database: bazinga/bazinga.db (unchanged)
├── Skill names: bazinga-db (aliased)
└── Agent paths: bazinga/*.json (unchanged)
```

**Why this approach:**
- Minimizes migration effort (no internal path changes)
- Preserves backward compatibility
- Clean public-facing brand
- Follows Chromium/Chrome pattern

---

### Migration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Brand Layer Only (v3.0)
- [ ] New CLI command name (with bazinga alias)
- [ ] New package name on PyPI
- [ ] Updated documentation/README
- [ ] New website/domain

#### Phase 2: Gradual Internal Migration (v3.1-v4.0)
- [ ] Add path abstraction layer
- [ ] Deprecation warnings for bazinga alias
- [ ] New skill aliases (e.g., `orchestrix-db`)
- [ ] Config-based path override

#### Phase 3: Full Migration (v5.0)
- [ ] Remove bazinga alias
- [ ] Rename internal paths (optional)
- [ ] Complete brand transition

---

### Rejected Suggestions (With Reasoning)

| Suggestion | Reason for Rejection |
|------------|---------------------|
| Keep original Top 10 | Too many collisions identified |
| "Crew" | CrewAI is a direct competitor |
| "Forge" | Atlassian Forge conflict |
| "DevForce" | Salesforce confusion |
| "Codex" | OpenAI Codex confusion |

---

### Required Due Diligence Before Selection

Before finalizing any name, must verify:

1. **Trademark Search**
   - USPTO/WIPO search for software/technology classes
   - Adjacent class conflicts

2. **Domain Availability**
   - .dev, .ai, .io variants
   - Reasonable acquisition cost

3. **Registry Availability**
   - PyPI package name
   - npm package name
   - Homebrew formula
   - Docker Hub

4. **CLI Collision Check**
   ```bash
   which orchestrix  # Should return nothing on fresh system
   ```

5. **Social Media Handles**
   - Twitter/X, GitHub org, LinkedIn

6. **International Check**
   - No negative meanings in major languages
   - Pronounceable globally
