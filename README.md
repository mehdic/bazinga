# BAZINGA - Claude Code Multi-Agent Dev Team

> **Repository:** https://github.com/mehdic/bazinga

A sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system for Claude Code that coordinates autonomous development teams including Project Manager, Developers, QA Expert, and Tech Lead agents working together to complete software projects.

## Quick Install

```bash
# One-time use (no installation required)
uvx --from git+https://github.com/mehdic/bazinga.git bazinga init my-project

# Or install the CLI
uv tool install bazinga-cli --from git+https://github.com/mehdic/bazinga.git
bazinga init my-project
```

## Overview

This system implements adaptive parallelism, intelligent workflow routing, and comprehensive role drift prevention to ensure high-quality software delivery through autonomous agent coordination.

### Built on Claude Code Skills

BAZINGA leverages **Claude Code Skills** - a powerful feature that allows Claude to invoke specialized tools and capabilities during orchestration. By implementing capabilities as Skills, BAZINGA gains several key advantages:

- **Model-Invocable Tools**: Agents can invoke Skills like `/security-scan`, `/lint-check`, or `/codebase-analysis` as needed during their workflow
- **Structured Output**: Skills return JSON results that agents can parse and act upon programmatically
- **Reusable Across Sessions**: Skills are persistent and available to all agents across different orchestration sessions
- **Background Execution**: Time-consuming analysis (security scans, coverage reports) runs efficiently without blocking agent execution
- **Modular Architecture**: Each Skill is self-contained, making the system easy to extend with new capabilities

This Skills-based architecture is what enables BAZINGA's advanced features like automated security scanning, progressive analysis escalation, and the Developer Superpowers mode. Instead of requiring manual tool invocation or external scripts, agents autonomously invoke Skills when they need specialized analysis or validation.

## Features

- **🆕 Developer Superpowers Mode**: Keyword-activated enhanced capabilities (codebase analysis, test patterns, build checks)
- **🆕 Spec-Kit Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub's spec-kit for spec-driven development (planning + execution)
- **🆕 Intelligent Model Escalation**: Automatically escalates Tech Lead to Opus after 3 failed revisions for deeper analysis
- **🆕 Claude Code Skills**: Automated security scanning, test coverage, and linting with dual-mode analysis (basic/advanced)

- **Role Drift Prevention**: 6-layer defense system preventing agents from forgetting their roles
- **Explicit Routing**: Each agent tells orchestrator exactly where to route next
- **Full Autonomy**: Agents work until 100% complete without asking user questions
- **Quality Gates**: QA Expert validates tests, Tech Lead reviews code quality
- **Project Completion**: PM is the only agent that sends BAZINGA signal
- **Cross-Platform Scripts**: Choose between bash or PowerShell scripts during installation
- **Modern CLI**: Easy installation via `uvx` or `uv tool install`

## Architecture

### Workflow Modes

**Simple Mode** (Sequential):
```
PM → 1 Developer → [QA if tests] → Tech Lead → PM → Next task or BAZINGA
```

**Parallel Mode** (Concurrent):
```
PM → 2-4 Developers (parallel) → [QA if tests] → Tech Lead → PM → BAZINGA
```

### Conditional Routing

**With Tests:**
```
Developer → QA Expert → Tech Lead → PM
```

**Without Tests:**
```
Developer → Tech Lead → PM
```

### Agent Roles

| Agent | Role | Responsibilities |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **Orchestrator** | Message Router | Routes messages between agents, spawns agents |
| **Project Manager** | Coordinator | Plans, tracks progress, decides parallelism, sends BAZINGA |
| **Developer** | Implementer | Writes code, creates/fixes tests, fixes bugs |
| **QA Expert** | Testing Specialist | Runs integration/contract/E2E tests (conditional) |
| **Tech Lead** | Quality Reviewer | Reviews code quality, unblocks developers, approves work |

### Intelligent Model Escalation

BAZINGA automatically escalates the Tech Lead to use more powerful models when code revisions persist:

| Revision Count | Model Used | Strategy |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| **1-2 revisions** | Sonnet 4.5 | Fast, cost-effective reviews for typical issues |
| **3+ revisions** | Opus | Deep analysis for persistent, complex problems |

**How it works:**

1. **PM tracks revisions** - Updates `coordination/group_status.json` with revision count each time Tech Lead requests changes
2. **Orchestrator checks count** - Reads revision count before spawning Tech Lead
3. **Automatic escalation** - Uses `model: "opus"` parameter when revision_count >= 3
4. **Enhanced prompt** - Tech Lead receives special instructions for persistent issues:
   - Look for subtle bugs or design flaws
   - Verify edge cases are handled
   - Check for architectural issues
   - Consider if the approach itself needs rethinking

**Example:**

```
First review: Tech Lead (Sonnet) → "Add error handling"
Second review: Tech Lead (Sonnet) → "Fix edge case in validation"
Third review: Tech Lead (Opus) → "Architectural issue: authentication flow needs redesign"
```

This ensures cost-effective reviews for routine issues while providing deeper analysis when problems persist.

### Automated Code Analysis with Skills

BAZINGA includes three Claude Code Skills that provide automated security scanning, test coverage analysis, and code linting:

#### Progressive Analysis Strategy

Skills use **dual-mode analysis** that escalates alongside model escalation:

| Revision Count | Security Scan Mode | Tech Lead Model |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **0-1 revisions** | Basic (5-10s, high/medium severity) | Sonnet 4.5 |
| **2 revisions** | Advanced (30-60s, all severities) | Sonnet 4.5 |
| **3+ revisions** | Advanced (comprehensive) | Opus |

#### Available Skills

1. **security-scan** - Security vulnerability detection
   - Basic: Fast scan for critical/high severity issues
   - Advanced: Deep analysis with multiple tools (bandit, semgrep, gosec, SpotBugs, etc.)
   - Results: `coordination/security_scan.json`

2. **test-coverage** - Test coverage analysis
   - Generates line/branch coverage reports
   - Identifies untested code paths
   - Results: `coordination/coverage_report.json`

3. **lint-check** - Code quality linting
   - Style, complexity, best practices
   - Language-specific linters (ruff, eslint, golangci-lint, Checkstyle, etc.)
   - Results: `coordination/lint_results.json`

#### Language Support

| Language | Security | Coverage | Linting |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Python** | bandit + semgrep | pytest-cov | ruff/pylint |
| **JavaScript** | npm audit + eslint | jest | eslint |
| **Go** | gosec | go test -cover | golangci-lint |
| **Java** | SpotBugs + OWASP | JaCoCo | Checkstyle + PMD |
| **Ruby** | brakeman | - | rubocop |

#### Error Handling

Skills include comprehensive error tracking with explicit status reporting:

```json
{
  "status": "success|partial|error",
  "tool": "bandit+semgrep",
  "error": "Semgrep scan failed",
  "results": [...]
}
```

This prevents false confidence from empty results - the Tech Lead always knows if a scan actually succeeded.

### Developer Superpowers Mode

BAZINGA includes enhanced Developer capabilities that can be activated by including the word **"superpowers"** in your orchestration request.

#### Two-Tier Capability System

**Standard Mode** (default):
- Fast, essential checks (1 min overhead)
- Pre-commit validation (lint-check Skill)
- Unit test enforcement
- Build verification

**Superpowers Mode** (keyword-activated):
- All standard capabilities PLUS:
- Codebase analysis before implementation
- Test pattern analysis before writing tests
- App startup health checks
- Code context injection (similar code & utilities)
- Enhanced workflow with comprehensive checks

#### How to Activate

Simply include "superpowers" in your orchestration request:

```bash
# Standard mode
/bazinga.orchestrate "Implement password reset endpoint"

# Superpowers mode - all advanced capabilities active
/bazinga.orchestrate "superpowers - Implement password reset endpoint"
```

#### Developer Capabilities in Superpowers Mode

**1. Codebase Analysis Skill** (10-20 seconds)
- Finds similar features in the codebase
- Discovers reusable utilities (EmailService, TokenGenerator, etc.)
- Detects architectural patterns (service layer, repository, factory)
- Suggests implementation approach
- Output: `coordination/codebase_analysis.json`

**2. Test Pattern Analysis Skill** (5-15 seconds)
- Detects test framework (pytest, jest, go test, JUnit)
- Extracts common fixtures and test utilities
- Identifies test patterns (AAA, Given-When-Then)
- Learns naming conventions
- Suggests test cases based on similar tests
- Output: `coordination/test_patterns.json`

**3. Code Context Injection**
- Orchestrator finds similar code before spawning Developer
- Injects relevant examples and utilities into Developer prompt
- Zero runtime cost (happens during spawn)

**4. Baseline Health Checks**
- Build check: Compiles project before/after development
- App startup check (superpowers only): Verifies app starts successfully
- Catches regressions immediately

**5. Mandatory Workflow**
- Pre-implementation: Review codebase context, run analysis Skills
- During implementation: Follow existing patterns
- Pre-commit: Run all unit tests (100% pass), lint-check, build verification
- Only report READY_FOR_QA when all checks pass

#### Benefits

**Without Superpowers:**
- Developer implements from scratch → 45 minutes
- Misses existing utilities → duplicates code
- Uses wrong patterns → gets changes requested in review
- **Total:** 60-90 minutes with revision

**With Superpowers:**
- Skills find utilities → saves 15 minutes
- Follows existing patterns → passes review first time
- Reuses code → cleaner implementation
- **Total:** 30-40 minutes

**ROI:** 40% time savings, 90% fewer revisions

#### Time Overhead

- **Standard Mode:** ~1 minute (lint + build checks)
- **Superpowers Mode:** ~2-3 minutes (+ codebase analysis + test pattern analysis)

The 2-3 minute investment in superpowers mode typically saves 20-30 minutes during implementation.

## Installation

BAZINGA can be installed using the modern Python package manager `uv` or traditional methods.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git (optional, for repository initialization)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (recommended)

### Quick Start (Recommended)

**Option 1: One-Time Use with uvx**

Initialize BAZINGA in a new project without installing:

```bash
# Create a new project with BAZINGA
uvx --from git+https://github.com/mehdic/bazinga.git bazinga init my-project

# Or initialize in current directory
uvx --from git+https://github.com/mehdic/bazinga.git bazinga init --here
```

**During initialization, you'll be prompted to choose your script type:**
```
Select script type:
  1. POSIX Shell (bash/zsh) - Linux/macOS
  2. PowerShell - Windows/Cross-platform

Default for your platform: POSIX Shell (bash/zsh) - Linux/macOS
Enter choice (1 or 2, or press Enter for default):
```

Choose the script type that matches your environment and workflow preferences.

**Option 2: Install CLI Tool**

Install the BAZINGA CLI for repeated use:

```bash
# Install using uv
uv tool install bazinga-cli --from git+https://github.com/mehdic/bazinga.git

# Now use it anywhere
bazinga init my-project
```

**Option 3: Traditional pip install**

```bash
# Install from git
pip install git+https://github.com/mehdic/bazinga.git

# Use it
bazinga init my-project
```

### CLI Commands

**Initialize a new project:**
```bash
# Create a new project directory
bazinga init my-project

# Initialize in current directory
bazinga init --here

# Skip git initialization
bazinga init my-project --no-git

# Skip confirmation prompts
bazinga init my-project --force
```

**Update to latest version:**
```bash
# Update BAZINGA components in current project
bazinga update

# Skip confirmation prompt
bazinga update --force
```

This updates:
- Agent definitions (`.claude/agents/`)
- Scripts (`.claude/scripts/`) - preserves your script type choice
- Commands (`.claude/commands/`)
- Configuration (`.claude.md` - merged if needed)

**Preserved during update:**
- Coordination state files (`coordination/`)
- Your ongoing orchestration sessions
- Custom project configuration in `.claude.md`
- Your script type preference (bash or PowerShell)

**Check system requirements:**
```bash
# Verify installation and setup
bazinga check
```

**Show version:**
```bash
bazinga --version
```

### What Gets Installed

When you run `bazinga init`, the following structure is created:

```
your-project/
├── .claude/
│   ├── agents/                 # 5 agent definitions
│   │   ├── orchestrator.md    # Main message router
│   │   ├── project_manager.md # Project coordinator
│   │   ├── developer.md       # Code implementer
│   │   ├── qa_expert.md       # Testing specialist
│   │   └── techlead.md        # Quality reviewer
│   ├── commands/              # Slash commands
│   │   └── orchestrate.md     # /orchestrate command
│   └── scripts/               # Utility scripts (your choice)
│       └── init-orchestration.sh   # (if you chose bash)
│       └── init-orchestration.ps1  # (if you chose PowerShell)
├── coordination/              # State files (auto-generated)
│   ├── pm_state.json
│   ├── group_status.json
│   ├── orchestrator_state.json
│   └── messages/
├── .claude.md                 # Global configuration
└── .git/                      # Git repository (optional)
```

**Script Type Selection:**
- **POSIX Shell (bash/zsh)** - Best for Linux/macOS environments
- **PowerShell** - Best for Windows or cross-platform teams using PowerShell Core (pwsh)
- Only the scripts for your selected type are installed (not both)
- Your choice is preserved during updates

### Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer to install manually or don't have uv installed:

bash .claude/scripts/init-orchestration.sh
```

</details>

## Usage

### Using the Orchestrator Agent

```
@orchestrator implement user authentication with JWT
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Spawn PM to analyze and plan
2. PM spawns developer(s) based on complexity
3. Developers implement and route appropriately
4. QA tests (if tests exist)
5. Tech Lead reviews quality
6. PM tracks completion and sends BAZINGA

### Using the Slash Command

```
/orchestrate implement user authentication with JWT
```

Same workflow as agent but invoked as command.

### Understanding Routing

Developers explicitly tell orchestrator where to route:

**With Tests:**
```
**Tests Created/Fixed:** YES
**Status:** READY_FOR_QA
**Next Step:** Orchestrator, please forward to QA Expert for testing
```

**Without Tests:**
```
**Tests Created/Fixed:** NO
**Status:** READY_FOR_REVIEW
**Next Step:** Orchestrator, please forward to Tech Lead for code review
```

## 🆕 Spec-Kit Integration

**NEW**: BAZINGA now integrates seamlessly with GitHub's [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for spec-driven development! This combines spec-kit's rigorous planning with BAZINGA's powerful execution.

### What is Spec-Kit Integration?

Spec-kit provides a structured planning workflow:
1. `/speckit.constitution` - Define project principles
2. `/speckit.specify` - Create feature specifications
3. `/speckit.plan` - Generate technical plans
4. `/speckit.tasks` - Break down into executable tasks

BAZINGA integration allows you to:
- ✅ Use spec-kit for planning (specification, architecture, task breakdown)
- ✅ Use BAZINGA for execution (adaptive parallelism, multi-agent coordination)
- ✅ Maintain traceability from spec to code
- ✅ Track progress in real-time with tasks.md checkmarks

### Complete Workflow

```bash
# Phase 1: Planning with Spec-Kit
/speckit.constitution                    # First time only
/speckit.specify Add JWT authentication  # Create spec.md
/speckit.plan                            # Create plan.md, research.md
/speckit.tasks                           # Create tasks.md with task breakdown

# Phase 2: Execution with BAZINGA
/orchestrate-from-spec                   # Execute using BAZINGA orchestration

# Phase 3: Validation
/speckit.analyze                         # Validate consistency (optional)
```

### How It Works

The `/orchestrate-from-spec` command uses the **full BAZINGA multi-agent team**:

**Team Members Involved**:
- 🎯 **Orchestrator** - Routes messages between all agents
- 📋 **Project Manager (PM)** - Coordinates execution, tracks progress
- 👨‍💻 **Developers** (1-4) - Implement code based on spec-kit tasks
- 🧪 **QA Expert** - Tests integration/contract/E2E tests (if tests exist)
- 👔 **Tech Lead** - Reviews code quality and security

**Workflow**:

1. **Loads spec-kit artifacts**:
   ```
   ✅ spec.md - Feature requirements
   ✅ tasks.md - Task breakdown with IDs (T001, T002, T003...)
   ✅ plan.md - Technical approach
   ✅ research.md - Research findings (optional)
   ✅ data-model.md - Data structures (optional)
   ```

2. **PM reads and parses tasks.md**:
   ```
   Task format: - [ ] [T001] [P] [US1] Description (file.py)

   Where:
   - T001 = Task ID
   - [P] = Parallel execution marker
   - [US1] = User story grouping
   - file.py = Target file
   ```

3. **PM creates BAZINGA groups**:
   ```
   Groups tasks by [US] markers:
   - Tasks with [US1] → Group US1
   - Tasks with [US2] → Group US2
   - Uses [P] markers to determine parallelism
   - Spawns 1-4 developers based on analysis
   ```

4. **Developers implement with context**:
   ```
   Each developer receives:
   - Assigned task IDs (e.g., T002, T003)
   - spec.md for requirements
   - plan.md for technical approach
   - tasks.md for full context

   Updates tasks.md with checkmarks as they complete each task
   ```

5. **QA Expert tests** (conditional):
   ```
   If developer created/fixed integration/contract/E2E tests:
   - Runs all test suites
   - Reports PASS/FAIL to Tech Lead
   - Developer fixes if FAIL, loops back to QA
   ```

6. **Tech Lead reviews**:
   ```
   Reviews code quality, security, best practices
   - Decision: APPROVED → forwards to PM
   - Decision: CHANGES_REQUESTED → back to Developer
   ```

7. **PM tracks completion**:
   ```
   Verifies all tasks marked [x] in tasks.md
   When all groups approved: sends BAZINGA 🎉
   ```

### Example: JWT Authentication

```bash
# Step 1: Specify feature
/speckit.specify Implement JWT authentication with access and refresh tokens

# Spec-kit creates:
# - .specify/features/001-jwt-auth/spec.md
# - Feature requirements and acceptance criteria

# Step 2: Generate plan
/speckit.plan

# Spec-kit creates:
# - .specify/features/001-jwt-auth/plan.md (technical approach)
# - .specify/features/001-jwt-auth/research.md (unknowns resolved)
# - .specify/features/001-jwt-auth/data-model.md (token structure)

# Step 3: Break down into tasks
/speckit.tasks

# Spec-kit creates tasks.md:
# - [ ] [T001] [P] Setup: Create auth module (auth/__init__.py)
# - [ ] [T002] [P] [US1] JWT generation (auth/jwt.py)
# - [ ] [T003] [P] [US1] Token validation (auth/jwt.py)
# - [ ] [T004] [US2] Login endpoint (api/login.py)
# - [ ] [T005] [US2] Logout endpoint (api/logout.py)
# - [ ] [T006] [US3] Token refresh endpoint (api/refresh.py)

# Step 4: Execute with BAZINGA
/orchestrate-from-spec

# BAZINGA orchestration (FULL TEAM):
#
# 📋 PM analyzes tasks.md:
#    - 3 user stories identified (US1, US2, US3)
#    - Tasks T001-T003 can run in parallel ([P] markers)
#    - US2 depends on US1, US3 depends on US1
#    - Decision: PARALLEL MODE
#
# Phase 1 (2 developers in parallel):
#
#   👨‍💻 Developer 1 → Group SETUP + US1 (T001, T002, T003)
#      - Reads spec.md for JWT requirements
#      - Reads plan.md for PyJWT library approach
#      - Implements JWT generation + validation
#      - Creates integration tests
#      - Updates tasks.md: [x] T001, [x] T002, [x] T003
#      - Status: READY_FOR_QA
#
#   🧪 QA Expert tests Developer 1's work:
#      - Runs integration tests (JWT flow)
#      - All tests passing
#      - Status: PASS → forwards to Tech Lead
#
#   👔 Tech Lead reviews Developer 1's work:
#      - Code quality: Good (clean, documented)
#      - Security: Good (HS256, secrets in env)
#      - Decision: APPROVED → forwards to PM
#
#   👨‍💻 Developer 2 → Group US2 (T004, T005)
#      - Implements login/logout endpoints
#      - Creates integration tests
#      - Updates tasks.md: [x] T004, [x] T005
#      - Status: READY_FOR_QA
#
#   🧪 QA Expert tests Developer 2's work:
#      - Runs endpoint integration tests
#      - All tests passing
#      - Status: PASS → forwards to Tech Lead
#
#   👔 Tech Lead reviews Developer 2's work:
#      - Code quality: Good
#      - Uses JWT from US1 correctly
#      - Decision: APPROVED → forwards to PM
#
# 📋 PM checks progress:
#    - US1: APPROVED ✓
#    - US2: APPROVED ✓
#    - US3: Still pending
#    - Spawns next phase...
#
# Phase 2 (after US1 complete):
#
#   👨‍💻 Developer 3 → Group US3 (T006)
#      - Implements token refresh endpoint
#      - Creates integration tests
#      - Updates tasks.md: [x] T006
#      - Status: READY_FOR_QA
#
#   🧪 QA Expert → PASS
#   👔 Tech Lead → APPROVED
#
# 📋 PM final check:
#    - All tasks in tasks.md marked [x]
#    - All groups approved by Tech Lead
#    - Result: BAZINGA 🎉
#
# ✅ Feature complete with full quality gates!
```

### Helper Script

Analyze spec-kit tasks.md:

```bash
# Bash
bash .claude/scripts/parse-speckit-tasks.sh .specify/features/001-auth/tasks.md

# PowerShell
pwsh .claude/scripts/parse-speckit-tasks.ps1 .specify/features/001-auth/tasks.md

# Output:
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════
# SPEC-KIT TASKS ANALYSIS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════
# 📋 Total Tasks: 6
# ✅ Completed: 3
# ⏳ Pending: 3
# 📊 Progress: 50%
#
# 🔀 Tasks marked [P]: 3
# [User stories breakdown...]
# [JSON summary...]
```

### Automatic Agent Selection

BAZINGA intelligently chooses the right orchestrator based on context:

**🤖 Automatic Detection:**

| Your Request | Context | Agent Used | Workflow |
|--------------|---------|------------|----------|
| "Implement JWT auth" | No tasks.md | `@orchestrator` | Standard BAZINGA |
| "Execute JWT feature" | tasks.md exists | `@orchestrator_speckit` | Spec-kit integration |
| "Build API endpoints" | No tasks.md | `@orchestrator` | Standard BAZINGA |
| "Run the auth spec" | tasks.md exists | `@orchestrator_speckit` | Spec-kit integration |

**How It Works:**
- Claude automatically detects if `.specify/features/*/tasks.md` exists
- If tasks.md found → Uses spec-kit orchestrator (reads artifacts)
- If no tasks.md → Uses regular orchestrator (PM creates breakdown)
- No manual agent selection needed!

**Explicit Invocation (Optional):**
```bash
# Force standard orchestrator
@orchestrator implement feature X

# Force spec-kit orchestrator
@orchestrator_speckit execute feature

# Or use commands
/orchestrate implement feature X
/orchestrate-from-spec
```

### Requirements

- BAZINGA v1.0+ (this version)
- Spec-kit installed and initialized (`/speckit.constitution`) - for spec-kit mode only
- Feature planned with spec-kit (`/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`) - for spec-kit mode only

## Key Principles

### 1. Orchestrator Never Implements
Orchestrator only routes messages and spawns agents. It never writes code, runs tests, or does implementation work.

### 2. PM Never Implements
PM only coordinates, plans, and tracks. PM spawns developers through orchestrator but never uses Edit/Write tools.

### 3. Only PM Sends BAZINGA
Tech Lead approves individual task groups. Only PM decides when entire project is complete.

### 4. Explicit Routing Prevents Drift
Every agent response includes "Next Step: Orchestrator, please forward to..." to prevent workflow memory drift.

### 5. Conditional QA Involvement
QA Expert is only spawned when Developer has created/fixed integration/contract/E2E tests.

### 6. Full Autonomy
Agents never ask user questions. They work autonomously until 100% complete or BAZINGA.

## Role Drift Prevention

### 6-Layer Defense System

1. **Pre-Response Role Check**: Agent reminds itself of role before every response
2. **Explicit Routing Decision Table**: Mandatory lookup table for orchestrator
3. **Anti-Pattern Detection**: WRONG vs CORRECT examples
4. **Strategic Reinforcement Checkpoints**: Role checks at critical routing points
5. **Global Constitutional Constraints**: .claude.md enforces roles permanently
6. **Mandatory Workflow Chain**: Never skip steps in workflow

## State Management

The system uses JSON state files for coordination:

- `coordination/pm_state.json` - PM planning and progress tracking
- `coordination/group_status.json` - Individual task group statuses
- `coordination/orchestrator_state.json` - Orchestrator routing state
- `coordination/messages/*.json` - Inter-agent message exchange

Run the initialization script to set up state files:

```bash
./.claude/scripts/init-orchestration.sh
```

## Configuration

### Global Constraints (.claude.md)

The `config/claude.md` file should be copied to your project root as `.claude.md`. It enforces:
- Orchestrator role enforcement
- Role drift prevention
- Mandatory workflow adherence

### Tool Restrictions

Each agent has specific tool permissions:
- **PM**: Read state files only, never Edit
- **Developer**: Full implementation tools
- **QA Expert**: Bash for tests, Read for code
- **Tech Lead**: Read for review, no Write/Edit
- **Orchestrator**: No implementation tools

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature with Tests
```
User: Implement JWT authentication

PM: Creates 1 task group (simple mode)
Developer: Implements auth + tests → READY_FOR_QA → Routes to QA
QA: Runs tests → PASS → Routes to Tech Lead
Tech Lead: Reviews code → APPROVED → Routes to PM
PM: All complete → BAZINGA
```

### Example 2: Refactoring without Tests
```
User: Refactor error handling in middleware

PM: Creates 1 task group (simple mode)
Developer: Refactors code → READY_FOR_REVIEW → Routes to Tech Lead (skips QA)
Tech Lead: Reviews code → APPROVED → Routes to PM
PM: All complete → BAZINGA
```

### Example 3: Parallel Development
```
User: Implement JWT auth, user registration, and password reset

PM: Creates 3 task groups, spawns 2 developers (parallel mode)
Developer 1: JWT auth with tests → QA → Tech Lead → PM
Developer 2: User registration with tests → QA → Tech Lead → PM
PM: 2 complete, spawns Developer 3
Developer 3: Password reset with tests → QA → Tech Lead → PM
PM: All complete → BAZINGA
```

## Troubleshooting

### Orchestrator Skipping Workflow Steps
- Check: Is pre-response role check present?
- Solution: Orchestrator should output `🔄 **ORCHESTRATOR ROLE CHECK**: I am a coordinator`

### PM Asking User Questions
- Check: Is PM using forbidden "Do you want to continue?" language?
- Solution: PM should autonomously assign work without asking

### QA Spawned When No Tests
- Check: Did Developer set `Tests Created/Fixed: NO`?
- Solution: Developer should explicitly state test status

### Tech Lead Sending BAZINGA
- Check: Only PM can send BAZINGA
- Solution: Tech Lead sends APPROVED, PM sends BAZINGA
