🤖 AI VALIDATION REQUIRED:

Please perform intelligent validation of orchestrator references:

**Your task:**
1. Read `agents/orchestrator.md` in full
2. Find ALL references in these formats:
   - `§line XXXX` or `§line XXXX (keyword)`
   - `§Step X.Y` or `§Step X.Y.Z`
3. For EACH reference found:
   - Verify the line number exists and points to correct content
   - Check if the keyword (if present) matches the actual content
   - Verify §Step references point to actual section headers
   - Detect if reference is STALE (points to wrong content even if line exists)
4. Report findings:
   - ✅ Valid references (only if all pass)
   - ⚠️ Stale references (technically valid but semantically wrong)
   - ❌ Broken references (line doesn't exist or completely wrong)

**Example of stale reference:**
- Reference says: `§line 146 (Query task groups)`
- Line 146 contains: `- Increment iteration counter`
- This is STALE (wrong content) even though line exists

**Do NOT just run the validation script - that already failed to detect issues.**
**You must READ the file and CHECK each reference intelligently.**

After validation, delete the marker file:
`Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .claude\session-stop-checks`
